__Proof-of-concept implementations of some (video) games.__

I wrote most of them (years ago) for students who just got introduced to C,
in order to demonstrate that it is not too ambitious to write a simple game
as a final project. Others were just fun projects of mine that fit into this
repository.


# CliMaedn
Pure terminal version of the German board game classic "Mensch Ã¤rgere Dich nicht".


# CursesBlocks
Ncurses version of a well known puzzle game that features falling [tetrominoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino).

Best played on a terminal font with square glyphs, e.g. [Square](https://strlen.com/square/).


# CursesBomber
Ncurses game, inspired by Bomberman.


# CursesPaddle
Ncurses version of another video game classic, featuring two paddles and a "ball".


# CursesSnake
Ncurses game, inspired by snake.

Best played on a terminal font with square glyphs, e.g. [Square](https://strlen.com/square/).


# NoGardenPuzzle
Rudimentary reimplementation in Haskell (using [gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss))
of the [Zen Garden game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/592660/Zen_Garden/).


# QtTicTacToe
Minimal implementation of [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) in C++/Qt.
