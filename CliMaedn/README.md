# CliMaedn
## Build requirements
None, any C compiler should do.

## Invokation
Run the binary with two to four player names as arguments, e.g.
`./CliMaedn Jane John Ghost`
to start a three player game.

## Controls
To "roll the dice" or progress to the next player, hit `Enter`.

When asked to "choose a token", give a numeric input 1, 2, 3 or 4, followed by `Enter`. (The tokens are displayed differently on the board for each player, though.)
